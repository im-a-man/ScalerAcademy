If you are asked about choosing between Kotlin DSL and Groovy DSL in an interview, the best approach
is to consider the context of the question and tailor your response accordingly. Here's a general
guideline:

1. **Kotlin DSL:**
    - # Highlight the benefits of Kotlin's static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time.
    - Emphasize the conciseness of Kotlin syntax and its modern language features, such as null
      safety, extension functions, and coroutines.
    - Mention Kotlin's full interoperability with Java, making it easy to integrate with existing
      Java libraries and frameworks.
    - If the interview context values a more modern and statically-typed approach, emphasize these
      aspects.

2. **Groovy DSL:**
    - # Highlight the dynamic typing in Groovy, which allows for more flexibility in certain scenarios.
    - Emphasize Groovy's concise and expressive syntax, which can result in more readable DSLs with
      less boilerplate code.
    - Mention Groovy's scripting capabilities, making it well-suited for DSLs in configuration files
      or domain-specific languages.
    - If the interview context values a more dynamic and concise scripting approach, highlight these
      aspects.

It's essential to consider the specific requirements of the job or project you're discussing. If the
team or project has a preference for a statically-typed, modern language with a focus on safety,
Kotlin might be more suitable. If flexibility, expressiveness, and a more dynamic approach are
valued, Groovy might be a better fit.

Remember to express your reasoning clearly and be prepared to discuss trade-offs based on the
characteristics of each language. Ultimately, your response should demonstrate an understanding of
the strengths and use cases of both Kotlin and Groovy DSLs.
