`LiveData`, `MutableLiveData`, and `MediatorLiveData` are classes in the Android Architecture Components that are used for building reactive and lifecycle-aware components in Android applications.
Preventing common issues like memory leaks by automatically handling the lifecycle of the observers.

1. **LiveData:**
- `LiveData` is an observable data holder class. It's part of the Android Architecture Components and is designed to be lifecycle-aware, meaning it is aware of the lifecycle of the components (like activities or fragments) that observe it.
- LiveData automatically manages the subscription to and unsubscription from the data stream based on the lifecycle of the observing components.
- LiveData is typically used to hold and observe data that needs to be updated in response to changes, and it helps in preventing common issues like memory leaks by automatically handling the lifecycle of the observers.

2. **MutableLiveData:**
- `MutableLiveData` is a subclass of `LiveData` that allows you to modify the stored value. While `LiveData` is immutable, `MutableLiveData` provides methods like `setValue` and `postValue` to update its value.
- It is commonly used when you have data that changes over time and needs to be observed by multiple components, such as UI elements in an Android app.

Example:
```java
MutableLiveData<String> mutableLiveData = new MutableLiveData<>();
mutableLiveData.setValue("Hello, LiveData!");
```

3. **MediatorLiveData:**
- `MediatorLiveData` is another subclass of `LiveData`. It allows you to combine and observe multiple sources of LiveData. It's useful when you want to observe changes in multiple LiveData instances and react accordingly.
- With `MediatorLiveData`, you can add multiple sources and define a callback that will be invoked whenever any of the source LiveData instances change.
- This is particularly helpful when you need to aggregate or transform data from multiple sources before updating the UI.

Example:
```java
MediatorLiveData<String> mediatorLiveData = new MediatorLiveData<>();
mediatorLiveData.addSource(sourceLiveData1, value -> updateCombinedValue());
mediatorLiveData.addSource(sourceLiveData2, value -> updateCombinedValue());
```

In summary, `LiveData` is the base class for building observable data holders, `MutableLiveData` is a subclass that allows modification of the stored value, and `MediatorLiveData` is a subclass that helps in observing and reacting to changes in multiple LiveData sources. The choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements of your application and the complexity of data interactions.
