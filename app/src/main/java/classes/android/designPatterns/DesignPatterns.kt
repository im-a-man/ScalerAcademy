    Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
    in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
    that you can customize to solve a particular
    design problem in your code.

    1-> Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

    Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
    Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
    Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

    2-> Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

    Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
    Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

    3-> Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
